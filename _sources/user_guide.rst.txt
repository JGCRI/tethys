Architecture
------------

Below is a conceptual overview of tethys. The downscaling process can be thought of in 2 main stages: First, the GCAM data is downscaled spatially, from 32 geopolitical regions and 235 basins to a 0.5 geographic degree grid. Then, that data is further downscaled temporally, from every 5 years to monthly. During both of these stages, water withdrawal data is downscaled separately within six sectors (irrigation, livestock, domestic, electricity generation, manufacturing, and mining), using data from various :ref:`input-files` and several :ref:`downscaling-algorithms`.

  *Flowchart of Tethys*

The resulting :ref:`output-files` are written to a folder, which can be specified by the user in the :ref:`configuration-file`. The config file also has options to make tethys perform diagnostics on the output, or even skip the temporal downscaling step, should that be desired.

.. _input-files:

Input files
-----------

This section contains descriptions of the example input files from :ref:`installing-package-data`, and some additional reference files included with tethys. Should you wish to run tethys with alternate input data, you'll need to prepare those files using this same structure.

GCAM
^^^^
The GCAM folder is where the regional water withdrawal data to be downscaled comes from. It actually contains full GCAM output databases (which have a lot of data other than water withdrawal, hence their size). These databases are queried for the relevant water withdrawal data across the six sectors (at the scale of 32 regions, every 5 years), which gets fed into tethys.

The example data contains 2 different output databases from GCAM: *gcam5p1_ref_db* and *ssp1_rcp26_gfdl*. There are are also 2 xml query files, *query_regaez.xml* and *query_regbasin.xml* corresponding to different versions of GCAM (regions and AEZ or regions and basins). The choice of database and query is indicated by the user in the config file.

The specifics of GCAM outputs and queries are outside the scope of this documentation. For more information, refer to RELEVANT_LINK.


rgn32
^^^^^
The *rgn32* folder contains additional information about these regions, such as region names, and various region-specific conversion ratios (eg, GCAM models the aggregate sheep+goat count in each region, but separate sheep and goat populations can be reconstructed from a "sheep to goat" ratio).

harmonized_inputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The term "grid" is used to describe the spatial resolution of 0.5 geographic degrees. A global full data map contains a total of 259,200 grid cells (360 x 720) of which 67,420 grid cells are categorized as "land grids" and are considered valid for simulation purposes. In this study, the land grid cells are used to define a "gridded" map according to the coordinates and the indexes of the 67,420 cells on the 360 x 720 grid. The inputs converted using the 67,420 grid cells according to the coordinate data file are called harmonized inputs.

Irrigation
""""""""""
The monthly gridded irrigation water withdrawal was estimated by relying on monthly irrigation results from other global hydrological models to quantify monthly weighting profiles of how irrigation is spread out within a year in a particular region and per crop type.

In this folder, three global gridded monthly irrigation water withdrawal models are provided as references for the period of 1971-2010:

* H08 (Hanasaki et al., 2008a; 2008b)

	* h08_wfdei_hist_varsoc_pirrww_global_monthly_1971_2010.nc
* LPJmL (Rost et al., 2008)

	* lpjml_wfdei_hist_varsoc_co2_pirrww_global_monthly_1971_2010.nc
* PCR-GLOBWB (Van Beek et al., 2011; Wada et al., 2011)

	* pcrglobwb_wfdei_varsoc_pirrww_global_monthly_1971_2010.nc

The original data files were obtained from ISI-MIP (Warszawski et al., 2014). We processed 
the original data files into gridded monthly percentage values as the weighting profiles 
applied in temporal downscaling of irrigation.

The data files are classic NetCDF file. They follow the same format:

* **Size**:       67420 x 480 
* **Dimensions**:  index, month 
* **Datatype**:   single 
* **Variables**: 'pirrww'

For more information about these three models and their data files, please refer to Huang 
et al., 2017.

.. _configuration-file:

Configuration file
------------------

Tethys uses an INI configuration file to specify the input data, options, and output folder. The example "config.ini" is extensively commented.

.. _output-files:

Output files
------------
Here is an overview of the example output files.

Diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^

Diagnostics_Spatial_Downscaling.csv
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This table is created by diagnostics module for spatial downscaling. It lists the water withdrawal values for each year, each region and each water demand sector comparing between downscaled results and input data from GCAM along with their differences.
 
Diagnostics_Temporal_Downscaling_Irrigation.csv
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Diagnostics_Temporal_Downscaling_Domestic.png
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Diagnostics_Temporal_Downscaling_Electricity.png
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
These three files are created by diagnostics module for temporal downscaling. A diagnostics table for irrigation sector will be generated listing the water withdrawal values for each year, each basin before and after temporal downscaling. Two figures will also be plotted to show the simulated monthly profiles for domestic sector and electricity generation sector respectively, comparing with overserved results. The observed monthly profiles were imported from files described in "tethys/reference" (Huang et al., 2017).

Downscaling Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The downscaled withdrawal results for each sector will be saved. They are divided into two groups, Spatial Downscaling (SD) results (the file name starts with "wd") and Temporal Downscaling (TD) results (the file name starts with "twd"). The following abbreviations for sectors are used in the file names:

======================	============
Sector Name				Abbreviation
======================	============
Domestic				dom
Electricity Generation	elec
Manufacturing			mfg
Mining					min
Irrigation				irr
Livestock				liv
======================	============

"nonag" is used for nonagricultural, which refers to the Domestic, Electricity Generation, Manufacturing, and Mining sectors.

.. _downscaling-algorithms:


Downscaling Algorithms
----------------------

Withdrawal data is downscaled spatially first (5 year regional -> 5 year gridded) then temporally (5 year gridded -> monthly gridded).

Spatial
^^^^^^^

For non-agricultural sectors (domestic, electricity, manfufacturing, and mining), water withdrawal in each grid square is assumed to be proportional to that square's population.



Temporal
