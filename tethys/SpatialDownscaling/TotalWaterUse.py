1. Add agriculture, livestock, and non-agriculture water withdrawal into one withdrawal map
withd_nonAg_map, OUT.wdirr, OUT.wdliv have no nan

2. Output downscaled results by region and time

3. Perform the  conversion from km3/yr to the output unit

    We use the grid-level representations of all the water withdrawal sources to aggregate them all into a total withdrawal. 
    When we go to re-aggregate them, we use the non-ag region map, since it will typically be the most detailed.
