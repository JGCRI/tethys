# Tethys

Demand for water is often modeled as part of integrated human-Earth systems models, such as GCAM, which operate at coarse spatiotemporal scales in order to model long-term global economic linkages. `tethys` was designed to downscale projections from such models, producing high-resolution water demand data consistent with global dynamics. This allows coupling with gridded hydrology models, which represent physical processes on much finer scales.

## Documentation
Check out [Getting Started](https://jgcri.github.io/tethys/getting_started.html) for installation and basic usage.
Details on methodology and advanced usage are available on the [User Guide](https://jgcri.github.io/tethys/user_guide.html).

## Installation

Install `tethys` using pip:

`pip install tethys-downscale`
