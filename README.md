# Summary
Demand for water is often modeled as part of integrated human-Earth systems models, such as GCAM, which operate at coarse spatiotemporal scales in order to model long-term global economic linkages. Tethys was designed to downscale projections from such models, producing high-resolution water demand data consistent with global dynamics. This allows coupling with gridded hydrology models, which represent physical processes on much finer scales.
