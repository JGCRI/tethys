Architecture
------------

Below is a conceptual overview of tethys. The downscaling process can be thought of in 2 main stages: First, the GCAM data is downscaled spatially, from 32 geopolitical regions and 235 basins to a 0.5 geographic degree grid. Then, that data is further downscaled temporally, from every 5 years to monthly. During both of these stages, water withdrawal data is downscaled separately within six sectors (irrigation, livestock, domestic, electricity generation, manufacturing, and mining), using data from various :ref:`input-files` and several :ref:`downscaling-algorithms`.

  *Flowchart of Tethys*

The resulting :ref:`output-files` are written to a folder, which can be specified by the user in the :ref:`configuration-file`. The config file also has options to make tethys perform diagnostics on the output, or even skip the temporal downscaling step, should that be desired.


.. _input-files:

Input files
-----------

This section contains descriptions of the example input files from :ref:`installing-package-data`, and some additional reference files included with tethys. Should you wish to run tethys with alternate input data, you'll need to prepare those files using this same structure.


.. note:: Adapted from https://github.com/JGCRI/tethys/blob/main/docs/ReadMe_IO_Data.pdf, may need to be further modified to reflect recent changes.

GCAM
^^^^
The GCAM folder is where the regional water withdrawal data to be downscaled comes from. It actually contains full GCAM output databases (which have a lot of data other than water withdrawal, hence their size). These databases are queried for the relevant water withdrawal data across the six sectors (at the scale of 32 regions, every 5 years), which gets fed into tethys.

The example data contains 2 different output databases from GCAM: *gcam5p1_ref_db* and *ssp1_rcp26_gfdl*. There are are also 2 xml query files, *query_regaez.xml* and *query_regbasin.xml* corresponding to different versions of GCAM (regions and AEZ or regions and basins). The choice of database and query is indicated by the user in the config file.

The specifics of GCAM outputs and queries are outside the scope of this documentation. For more information, refer to RELEVANT_LINK.


rgn32
^^^^^
The *rgn32* folder contains additional information about these regions, such as region names, and various region-specific conversion ratios (eg, GCAM models the aggregate sheep+goat count in each region, but separate sheep and goat populations can be reconstructed from a "sheep to goat" ratio).

*RgnNames.csv*

harmonized_inputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The term "grid" is used to describe the spatial resolution of 0.5 geographic degrees. A global full data map contains a total of 259,200 grid cells (360 x 720) of which 67,420 grid cells are categorized as "land grids" and are considered valid for simulation purposes. In this study, the land grid cells are used to define a "gridded" map according to the coordinates and the indexes of the 67,420 cells on the 360 x 720 grid. The inputs converted using the 67,420 grid cells according to the coordinate data file are called harmonized inputs.

Irrigation
""""""""""
The monthly gridded irrigation water withdrawal was estimated by relying on monthly irrigation results from other global hydrological models to quantify monthly weighting profiles of how irrigation is spread out within a year in a particular region and per crop type.

In this folder, three global gridded monthly irrigation water withdrawal models are provided as references for the period of 1971-2010:

* H08 (Hanasaki et al., 2008a; 2008b)

	* *h08_wfdei_hist_varsoc_pirrww_global_monthly_1971_2010.nc*

	* *pcrglobwb_wfdei_varsoc_pirrww_global_monthly_1971_2010.nc*

The original data files were obtained from ISI-MIP (Warszawski et al., 2014). We processed 
the original data files into gridded monthly percentage values as the weighting profiles 
applied in temporal downscaling of irrigation.

The data files are classic NetCDF file. They follow the same format:

* **Size**:       67,420 x 480 
* **Dimensions**:  index, month 
* **Datatype**:   single 
* **Variables**: 'pirrww'

For more information about these three models and their data files, please refer to Huang 
et al., 2017.

ClimateForcing/WATCH
""""""""""""""""""""
For temporal downscaling of electricity and domestic water withdrawal from annual to monthly, the gridded daily air temperature data from WATCH forcing data methodology applied to Era Interim reanalysis data (WFDEI) from 1971 to 2010 is applied (Weedon et al., 2014).

Output files
------------
Below is an overview of the example output files.

Downscaling Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The downscaled withdrawal results for each sector will be saved. They are divided into two groups, Spatial Downscaling (SD) results (file names starting with "wd") and Temporal Downscaling (TD) results (file names starting with "twd"). The following abbreviations for sectors are used in the file names:

======================	============
Sector Name				Abbreviation
======================	============
Domestic				dom
Electricity Generation	elec
Manufacturing			mfg
Mining					min
Irrigation				irr
Livestock				liv
======================	============

The abbreviation "nonag" is used for non-agricultural sectors (i.e. the total of all but irrigation and livestock).


*wd(sector)_km3peryr.csv*
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
There are 8 spatial downscaling result files. One for each of the 6 sectors (dom/elec/mfg/min/irr/liv), combined results for the non-agricultural sectors (nonag), and the totals (total).

* **File Format:** csv, one-row header 
* **Dimension:** 67,420 rows x 5+ columns (grid ID, lon, lat, ilon, ilat; first_year, ... , last_year)
* **Unit:** km\ :sup:`3`

*twd(sector)_km3permonth.csv*
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
There are 6 temporal downscaling result files, one for each of the 6 sectors (dom/elec/mfg/min/irr/liv).

* **File Format:** csv, one-row header 
* **Dimension:** 67,420 rows x 5+ columns (grid ID, lon, lat, ilon, ilat; first_month, ... , last_month)
* **Unit:** km\ :sup:`3`


Diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^
By default, Tethys will also output diagnostics files for quality control. These allow the user to verify the downscaling process has preserved the total amount of water used within a region for each time step, ensuring the output grid satisfies the boundary conditions imposed by GCAM.

*Diagnostics_Spatial_Downscaling.csv*
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This table is created by the diagnostics module for spatial downscaling. It lists the water withdrawal values for each year by region, and each water demand sector, comparing between downscaled results and input data from GCAM along with their differences.

*Diagnostics_Temporal_Downscaling_Irrigation.csv*
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
*Diagnostics_Temporal_Downscaling_Domestic.png*
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
*Diagnostics_Temporal_Downscaling_Electricity.png*
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
.. note:: I don't believe the png files are currently created.

These three files are created by the diagnostics module for temporal downscaling. A diagnostics table for irrigation sector will be generated listing the water withdrawal values for each year, each basin before and after temporal downscaling. Two figures will also be plotted to show the simulated monthly profiles for domestic sector and electricity generation sector respectively, comparing with overserved results. The observed monthly profiles were imported from files described in "tethys/reference" (Huang et al., 2017).

.. _downscaling-algorithms:


Downscaling Algorithms
----------------------
Withdrawal data is downscaled spatially first, then temporally.

Spatial
^^^^^^^

Non-agricultural
""""""""""""""""
For non-agricultural sectors (domestic, electricity, manfufacturing, and mining), water withdrawal in each grid square is assumed to be proportional to that square's population.

Irrigation
""""""""""
Irrigation water withdrawal is downscaled using global coverage of gridded cropland areas equipped with irrigation.

Livestock
"""""""""
The gridded global maps of livestock in six types (cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, pigs and poultry) are used as proxy to downscale livestock water withdrawal.


Temporal
^^^^^^^^
When the data from GCAM is not annual, such as the 5-year increments from the example, annual data is estimated in an intermediate step by applying linear interpolation to the spatial downscaling results. Then, the following algorithms are applied to the annual estimates to produce monthly estimates for each sector.

Livestock, Manufacturing, and Mining
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
For the livestock, manufacturing and mining sectors, it was assumed that water withdrawal is uniform throughout the year.

..
	Different months have different numbers of days, so I'm guessing rather than month_withdrawal = year_withdrawal/12, something like month_withdrawal = year_withdrawal*(month_days/year_days) is used?

Irrigation
""""""""""
The monthly gridded irrigation water withdrawal was estimated by relying on monthly irrigation results from several global hydrological models to quantify monthly weighting profiles of how irrigation is spread out within a year in a particular region and per crop type.

Domestic
""""""""
Temporally downscaling domestic water withdrawal from annual to monthly was based on a formula utilizing monthly temperature data.

Electricity Generation
""""""""""""""""""""""
Temporally downscaling electricity generation water withdrawal from annual to monthly was based on the assumption that the amount of water withdrawal for electricity generation is proportional to the amount of electricity generated.
